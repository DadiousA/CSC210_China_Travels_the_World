Web application: 
Wan'U

Targeted audience: 
The world travelers.

Problems intended to solve:
We help travelers to share their traveling experience. 
The travelers will be able to store their photos on our site and write notes to their photos. Other users can view these photos on the public domain.

Minimum requirements: 
We allow users to create, update and delete accounts. Each account holder will have a user name and a dedicated webpage, and will be able to upload, read and delete their photos, as well as write notes to their photos. 
Users will also be able to edit their preferences.
People not logged in will still be able to browse the public gallary.
We will also make sure the Ajax technology is deployed in our site.

Beyond the basics: 
 a great user experience: Well-designed webpage, with easy-to-understand interactions.
 real-time updates: The database, as well as the image gallary, will keep updated. All these happened without reload the browser page.
 sophisticated use of external APIs: good use of jssor API, which made the gallary possible.
 file commands on server side: we manuplate files on server side. 
 advanced use of ajax: upload and read files through ajax.
