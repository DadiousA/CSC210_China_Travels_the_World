Milestone 1

Web application: 
China_Travels_the_World.

Targeted audience: 
The 1.4 billion Chinese people.

Problems intended to solve:
We help Chinese travelers to share their traveling experience. 
The travelers will be able to store their photos on our site and write blogs. Other users, when granted permission, will be able to make comments. In addition, we will allow the users to vote for the most inspiring image of the week: Image of the Week.

Minimum requirements: 
We allow users to create, update and delete accounts. Each account holder will have a user name and a dedicated webpage, and will be able to upload their photos and write blogs. 
People not logged in will still be able to browse/read our site, but they shall not be able to vote or make comments.
We will also make sure the Ajax technology is deployed in our site.

Beyond the basics: 
We intend to use Artificial Intelligence to mine the images stored  in our database so as to improve the browsing experience. Specifically, we will parse the texts and images to geo-locate each image as finely as possible. Moreover, it is our goal that we should be able to identify images with such iconic objects as the Eiffel Tower and the Statue of Liberty.
